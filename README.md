# AIRLINE-FARE-PREDICTION
Prediction of Airline ticket price in India.

# OVERVIEW 
The project used some variables such duration of flight,
Source and Destination of flight,the Airline carrier,
The date and month the flight and number of total stops within 
the trip to predict the Airline ticket price in India for the year 2019.

# Methodology and conclusion 
After formatting, manipulating and cleaning the data,the data was split into training and test data.
Three different statistical learning techniques was used to fit the model.Of the methods,random forest out preform the rest, followed by ridge regression and finally linear regression.
After cross validation using random grid search to find the best parameters for our random forest model. It came out that our model was able to explain 96.5% of out test data.
In addition,the important features that affect our model the most are:

1.Total number of stops during the flight.

2.Duration .

3.Date(Day of the month).

4.Airline .
